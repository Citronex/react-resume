    "bio":"I never feel like I know enough. 7 years ago when I started working in QA I decided to also get a Masters in Internet Technology with a concentration in e-commerce. Right after I finished, I was assigned a project that involved building an Android and iOS app from the ground up. Overwhelmed with the amount of manual work, I started learning Swift on my own to create an automation framework for the iOS project. This then allowed me to work with the Espresso framework on the Android app and freed me enough to start learning web automation. After I became good enough with Java I joined the web-automation team, and I’ve been automating test cases ever since. However, I still wanted to learn more, so I completed a scholarship challenge from Udacity and I was awarded the chance to ear a nanodegree in Frontend development for free. Currently, I'm reading about brain plasticity and statistics, because the future of automated testing is the automation of it, and I believe neural networks are here to help. If I'm wrong about this, at least I'd have learned a bit about neural networks… and that’s already pretty cool to me! When I’m not working, you can find me playing soccer, training for a marathon, or walking my dog.",    "email": "fxmejias@gmail.com",
