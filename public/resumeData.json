    "bio":"I never feel like I know enough. 7 years ago when I started working in QA I decided to also get a Masters in Internet Technology with a concentration in e-commerce. I wanted to know as much as possible about e-commerce technologies in order to become the best at what had become my career path. After I finished the degree, I was working in a project that involved building an Android and iOS app from the ground up. After getting tired of manual testing (luckily at the same time Swift was born), I started learning Swift on my own and created an automation framework to test this robust iOS app. This also allowed me to then do some work with Espresso on the Android app and freed me enough to start learning web automation. So after I became good enough at Java I joined the web-automation team and I’ve been automating test cases for over 2 years now. I still didn not think I knew enough, so I completed a scholarship challenge where over 10,000 people competed to get a scholarship for a free nanodegree sponsored by Google and Udacity, and I got it. Now I have experience in iOS, Android, and web automation, and also a nanodegree to prove I know enough about frontend development to tackle JavaScript related projects. However, did I mention I never think I know enough? I’m currently reading about brain plasticity and statistics, because the future of automated testing is the automation of it, and I believe neural networks are here to help. The cool thing about being wrong regarding this prediction, is that at least I’ll learn about neural networks… and that’s already pretty cool to me! When I’m not working, you can find me playing soccer, training for a marathon, or walking my dog.",
